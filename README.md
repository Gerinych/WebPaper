Retrieves satellite images and sets them as a wallpaper

This solution was created using Visual Studio 2015, so trying to open the .sln or .csproj file using any older versions will probably not work. You can, however, create a new C# Windows Forms Application project and import all the necessary files.
This program requires .NET Framework 2.0. There's not a lot of advanced features, so I didn't see the point in restricting it to newer version of .NET when the old versions work just fine.
The binary files are in WebPaper/bin/Debug.
